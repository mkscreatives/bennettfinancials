## Introduction

Most business owners discover their cash flow problem the same way—**payroll is due Friday and the account is $40,000 short**.  
By then, your options have narrowed to expensive emergency financing or difficult conversations about delayed paychecks.

A **fractional CFO** who specializes in cash flow management builds forecasting systems and operational controls that expose liquidity problems *weeks before they become crises*, giving you time to act strategically rather than react emotionally.  

This guide explains:
- What cash-focused fractional CFOs actually do  
- How to evaluate the top firms  
- What deliverables separate real experts from generalists

## What a Fractional CFO Does for Cash Flow

A **fractional CFO** is a part-time strategic finance leader who manages forward-looking cash flow and financial forecasting.  
They differ from bookkeepers in one key way: **bookkeepers record what happened; fractional CFOs predict what’s next**.

Top firms in this space include:
- **FocusCFO** – cash flow and internal accounting systems  
- **Zeni** – AI-powered cash forecasting platform  
- **Bennett Financials** – cash flow optimization integrated with tax strategy for service-based businesses  

A bookkeeper might tell you that you had **$47,000 in cash on January 31**.  
A fractional CFO shows you whether you can hire three new employees in Q2 without running out of runway by September.

### 1. Builds 13-Week Cash Forecasts
A **13-week cash forecast** projects inflows and outflows weekly over the next three months.  
It predicts cash shortfalls before they happen, allowing time to:
- Secure a line of credit  
- Delay nonessential expenses  
- Accelerate collections  

This rolling model updates weekly, keeping your visibility fresh and accurate.

---

### 2. Designs Real-Time Dashboards
**Dashboards** connect directly to bank accounts and accounting systems, giving real-time visibility into:
- Current cash balance  
- Burn rate  
- Runway  

You can see trends as they happen—like a 30% drop in booked calls—*not weeks later* when the data is stale.

---

### 3. Secures Funding or Credit Lines
A fractional CFO creates investor-ready financial packages with:
- Historical performance  
- Forward projections  
- Clear capital utilization plans  

They negotiate credit terms aligned with your cash cycle—so debt supports operations instead of straining liquidity.

---

### 4. Links Tax Strategy to Liquidity
**Tax decisions directly affect cash flow.**  
A fractional CFO coordinates tax planning to optimize cash availability, avoiding surprise tax bills that drain liquidity.

Example: an equipment purchase may save $30K in taxes but drain working capital before a slow season.  
Strategic CFOs time these decisions for *both* savings and stability.

---

## Why Outsourcing Beats Hiring In-House

Hiring a full-time CFO costs **$200K–$400K annually** (including benefits, equity, and recruiting).  
Fractional CFOs deliver the same expertise for **$3K–$10K/month**—a fraction of the cost.

### Benefits of the Fractional Model
- **Cost Efficiency:** 1/5 to 1/10 the total cost of a full-time CFO  
- **Immediate Impact:** No onboarding delay or learning curve  
- **Specialized Expertise:** Experience solving similar cash flow challenges across industries  

💡 Best suited for businesses between **$1M and $10M** in revenue—those needing CFO strategy but not full-time headcount.

## Key Cash Flow Deliverables You Should Expect

You’re not buying “advice.” You’re buying *systems* that protect liquidity and drive confidence.

### 1. Burn Rate Analysis
Calculates monthly cash consumption and breaks it down by category (payroll, contractors, software, etc.).  
You’ll know:
- Current burn rate  
- Runway left  
- Where to adjust spending  

Example: Burning $150K/month with $600K in the bank = 4 months of runway.  

---

### 2. Scenario Planning Packs
Models **best-case, worst-case, and most-likely** outcomes with clear contingency plans.  
If revenue drops 20%, the plan outlines exactly:
- Which expenses to pause  
- When to secure financing  
- How to extend runway  

This turns uncertainty into *data-driven decision-making*.

---

### 3. Monthly Driver KPIs
Tracks early-warning metrics that predict cash stress before it hits:
- **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)** – customer payment delays  
- **Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)** – your vendor payments  
- **Inventory turns** – cash trapped in stock  

When DSO creeps from 32 → 45 days, your CFO acts *now*, not after a crisis.

Look for sector-specific expertise.  
Ask for **case studies** with measurable outcomes, e.g.:
> “Reduced DSO from 52 to 34 days, freeing $180K in working capital.”

### 2. Forecasting Methodology
Ensure they use **rolling 13-week forecasts**, not static annual budgets.  
Outdated spreadsheets = outdated insights.

### 3. System Integration
Top firms use **real-time connected systems**, not manual Excel exports.  
Your dashboards should update as soon as cash hits the bank.
