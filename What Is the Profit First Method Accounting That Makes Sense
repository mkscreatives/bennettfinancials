## Introduction  
You’re working hard, but it feels like you’re not getting anywhere. You’re not sure if you’re making a profit or not. What do you do?  
It’s tough to decide where to allocate your resources when you don’t have a clear understanding of your company’s financial situation. You need accurate information to make informed decisions to help your business grow and be profitable. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
This guide explains the Profit First Method — a system that helps business owners focus on profit rather than leaving it as an afterthought.

---

## What Is the Profit First Method?  
The Profit First Method flips the traditional accounting formula from:  
> Revenue − Expenses = Profit  
to:  
> Revenue − Profit = Expenses :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
It emphasises taking profit *first*, then managing what remains as expenses — a shift that builds financial discipline and clarity.

---

## How It Started  
The method was developed by Mike Michalowicz, who observed that many businesses generated revenue yet still struggled with cash flow and profitability. The Profit First system gained popularity by providing a practical structure around this idea. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Core Concepts: CAPS & TAPS  
Within this framework, two important concepts are:  
- **CAPS**: Current Allocation Percentages — what you’re currently allocating across categories. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **TAPS**: Target Allocation Percentages — what you *should* aim to allocate for profit, tax, owner’s pay, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
These help guide the transition to a financially disciplined model.

---

## How to Set it Up  
Key steps include:  
1. Open separate bank accounts for: Income, Profit, Owner’s Pay, Taxes, Operating Expenses. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
2. Decide on your Target Allocation Percentages based on your revenue size and industry. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
3. On regular intervals (e.g., every 10th & 25th), allocate revenue from the Income account into the other accounts according to the percentages. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
4. Use whichever remains in the Operating Expenses account to run the business — forcing expense discipline.  
5. Review and adjust periodically as your business grows.

## Why It Matters  
- It **guarantees profit** rather than hoping for it at year‐end. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- It builds **cash flow clarity** so you know where money is going. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- It aligns your business structure with sustainable growth, not just revenue growth.  
- It simplifies decision-making under pressure — fewer surprises, more control.

---

## Implementation Tips  
- Start with conservative allocations if your margins are tight — it’s better to begin small than to overpromise and underdeliver.  
- Stick to the rhythm so it becomes habit — allocations on fixed dates bring discipline.  
- Monitor results and adjust your allocations as you improve margins or reduce overhead.

---

## Is This Right for You?  
The Profit First Method works best for service businesses, small companies, consultancies, or founders who:  
- Have revenue, but uncertain profit  
- Are tired of living “cash light” despite growth  
- Want to build a business that *makes money* and *maintains it*  
However, if you’re in a high-growth burn stage where profitability is secondary to scaling, this method may require adaptation.

---

## Final Takeaway  
Profit isn’t a nice-to-have. With the Profit First Method, profit becomes a *habit*. You allocate it first, then you manage the rest.  
For business owners ready to shift from “making revenue” to “making money”, this method brings structure, clarity, and strategic value.
