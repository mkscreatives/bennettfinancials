The S-Corporation structure can unlock serious tax savings—but only if it’s set up correctly. Most business owners elect too early, miss payroll rules, or skip critical filings that quietly cost thousands. This short guide walks you through what to do (and what to avoid) so your S-Corp actually works in your favor. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

2. File the official S-Corp election (IRS Form 2553) within the required timeframe.  
3. Set up payroll for the owner(s) with a **reasonable salary** and handle payroll taxes correctly.  
4. Maintain proper corporate formalities, distributions vs. salary distinctions, and keep separate accounting.  
5. Monitor compliance and tax filings annually to avoid IRS penalties.

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them  
- Electing S-Corp status too early (you’re not yet profitable)  
- Paying insufficient owner salary and risking IRS scrutiny

- Overlooking ongoing compliance and tax obligations

## Final Takeaway  
An S-Corp can be a powerful tool for growth-minded business owners—but only if the foundation is built strong. It starts with correct timing, disciplined payroll and compliance, and a clear strategy rather than ad-hoc decision-making.
