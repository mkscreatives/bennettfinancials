## Introduction  
Most sole proprietors pay themselves wrong — and it costs them thousands. When you know how to pay yourself correctly, you stay IRS-compliant, protect every deduction, and keep more of what you earn. This quick guide shows you how to:  
- Pay yourself legally using an **Owner’s Draw**.  
- Avoid costly IRS penalties and missed deductions.  
- Plan for tax savings with the right structure.  
- Stop guessing how much to pay yourself or when. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Why Proper Payroll Matters for Sole Proprietors  
When you’re the business, how you compensate yourself and manage payroll (or draw) affects taxes, retirement, cash flow, and compliance. Too often the owner treats themselves like an after-thought—salary based on what’s left over—and the business pays the price.

## Key Areas Covered in This Guide  
- **Owner’s Draw vs. Salary** — For sole proprietors, there’s no W-2 salary like an employee; the correct structure must reflect your business and tax setup. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Tax Implications & Withholdings** — Even if you’re simply drawing money, you still must consider self-employment tax, estimated quarterly taxes, and proper documentation. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Business Structure Impact** — Your structure (sole proprietor, LLC, S-Corp) changes payroll requirements and what counts as salary vs draw.  
- **Documentation & Compliance** — Clear records, bank separation, correct set-up avoid IRS surprises and keep your financial house in order.

## Actionable Steps for Sole Proprietors  
1. Set up a separate business bank account to track revenue, expenses and owner draw clearly.  
2. Decide your draw schedule — consistent, documented, and based on business cash flow.  
3. Estimate taxes ahead of time; set aside percentages for income tax and self-employment tax.  
4. Review whether your current business structure still fits—when volume or complexity increases, you may need to transition to a different structure.  
5. Keep everything documented: draws, business profits, tax payments—this protects you and your business.

## Final Takeaway  
Being your own boss means more than calling yourself a business owner—it means managing yourself as the business’s executive. Paying yourself correctly isn’t extra—it’s foundational. When you treat draw and payroll with discipline, you protect your compliance, your cash flow and your growth potential.
